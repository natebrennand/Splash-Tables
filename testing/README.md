##Using Test Scripts

Move the `.sh` files to the `Part1` directory.
Exit the `test_all.sh` file if you wish to add more options, then execute it.


##Stat Scripts

Simply pass in a test output to the `stat.py` file to find the MIN, MAX, and AVG of the test data.

```bash
python stat.py <stat file>
```
